2008.05.21.:
 - Updated Cairo to v1.6.4
 - Updated libPixman to 0.10.0
 - Added new OS/2 specific functions:
     cairo_os2_surface_set_draw_offset()
     cairo_os2_surface_get_draw_offset()
     cairo_os2_surface_set_hps()
 - Updated forwarder DLLs to forward to new Cairo DLL
 - Updated FontConfig-emulation code to latest (from Mozilla)

2008.01.18.:
 - Updated Cairo to v1.4.14
 - Added forwarder DLLs so apps linked to old Cairo DLLs can use new DLL

2007.09.19.:
 - Added new OS/2-specific functions to v1.4.6, named it v1.4.7

2007.05.11:
 - Updated Cairo to v1.4.6

2006.09.26:
 - Updated Cairo to v1.2.4

2006.08.09:
 - Updated Cairo to v1.2.2
 - Added FcPatternDel() as a stub to FontConfig/2

2006.08.02:
 - API name changes, requested by original Cairo author

2006.07.30:
 - Replaced the FontConfig+Expat combination with our own small code.
   This should fix fonts.cache problems.

2006.03.14:
 - Modified FontConfig so it won't put fonts.cache* files into your home and
   all of its subfolders, only into PSFONTS folder.
 - Changed compiler to Innotek GCC. This fixes some crashes with DSSaver
   modules, however this makes the DLL dependent on LIBC 06 GA release.

2005.12.22:
 - Implemented dirty_area support. The following Cairo functions will work now:
   cairo_surface_mark_dirty(), cairo_surface_mark_dirty_rectangle()
   You can use them to initialize a newly created surface with pixels from the 
   window (HPS) itself.
 - Updated comments for the APIs in cairo-os2.h file, they were out of date.
   
2005.11.01:
 - Last change was based on old makefile which broke DLL. Fixed makefile.
 - INITINSTANCE and TERMINSTANCE was missing from lnk file, so the DLL did
   not do a cleanup, resulting in huge memory leakage. Fixed.
 - Added new API: cairo_os2_surface_set_HWND()
   See cairo-os2.h for details!
 - Fixed memory leaks in FontConfig.

2005.10.20:
 - Updated code to Cairo 1.0.2 level
 - Modified makefile so it now creates DLL file with version in name
   (e.g.: cairo102.dll)
 - Added two new OS/2-specific API: 
   cairo_os2_initialize() and cairo_os2_uninitialize()
   These are called automatically it Cairo is compiled to be a DLL, but you
   have to call them once if you link to Cairo statically.
 - Separated these two functions into new file to ease the static compilation.
 - Removed libSVG code from DLL as it doesn't really belong to Cairo, and as
   its development has been stopped.

2005.09.03:
 - Created changelog
 - Slightly modified OS2_Patch.c file for the patches to look nicer.
 - Modified makefile, changed compiler switches.
   The adding of '-of' was required in order to make FreeType2 library
   work properly. Without stack frames, the library messes with the
   stack, and the application crashes (mostly when T1 fonts are used).
 - Modified makefile, put a new line to linker file to create more
   verbose map file.
